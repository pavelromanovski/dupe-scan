usage: dupescan.py [-h] [-v] [-hi] [location]

Peeks around a specified folder and its subfolders checking if any duplicate
files exist. Whether a file is considered a duplicate depends on its contents,
not its filename.

If in non-verbose mode, returns nothing if there aren't any
file collisions. Otherwise, it returns the filenames with their paths that
contain the same object.

positional arguments:
  location       file location of where to begin search

optional arguments:
  -h, --help     show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose  verbose mode
  -hi, --hidden  scans all files including hidden files and folders
